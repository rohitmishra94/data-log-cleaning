    "strengths": [
      "Comprehensive data coverage with 666K events from 4K users over 32 days",
      "Well-structured report with clear sections and good formatting",
      "Detailed funnel analysis identifying specific drop-off points",
      "Good event classification and pattern discovery approach",
      "Executive summary format makes key findings accessible"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Future dates in dataset (2026) suggest synthetic/test data quality issues",
      "Mathematical impossibility in funnel (1417% conversion rate)",
      "Assumes 100% of app users intend to make purchases",

      "Funnel calculation error: Claims 1417% conversion from Payment to Ticket stages",
      "Revenue projections assume all 3,961 users would purchase (\u20b91.845M opportunity) - completely unrealistic",
      "81.9% of users ending with 'Push Failure' suggests data quality problems, not user behavior",

      "rationale": "Industry benchmarks show 5-15% of app users have purchase intent. Current 6.84% conversion is actually reasonable. Realistic improvements might achieve 8-12% conversion, adding ~100-150 bookings worth \u20b950,000-75,000. The seat selection and booking form improvements could realistically recover 10-20% of current drop-offs, not the 75%+ claimed."
